## Focus Mode

The unique feature of this app is its adaptive focus mode:

### When Focused (Active Window)
- Full interface with all controls visible
- Standard window size (320Ã—480)
- Complete task management capabilities

### When Unfocused (Background Window)
- Compact window size (250Ã—400)
- Shows only task names with larger font size
- Hides controls, title bar, and other UI elements
- Creates a clean, distraction-free list
- Remains visible but unobtrusive

This dual-mode functionality helps you keep your tasks visible while working on other applications without taking up excessive screen space.

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- Built with PyQt6 for modern UI components
- Implements custom-styled widgets throughout
- Uses JSON for data persistence
- Custom window management (frameless, movable window)

### Task Data Structure
```python
{
    "id": "20250427173314123456",  # Timestamp-based unique ID
    "text": "Example task",         # Task description
    "completed": False,             # Completion status
    "priority": "medium",           # Priority level
    "created_at": "2025-04-27 17:33:14"  # Creation timestamp
}
```

### Key Components
- **TaskCard**: Displays individual tasks with priority, checkbox, and delete button
- **PriorityButton**: Custom button for indicating and changing task priority
- **ModernTodoApp**: Main application window with focus detection and UI state management

self.NORMAL_WIDTH = 320      # Width when focused
self.NORMAL_HEIGHT = 480     # Height when focused
self.COMPACT_WIDTH = 250     # Width when unfocused
self.COMPACT_HEIGHT = 400    # Height when unfocused
```

### Font Sizes
Look for `font-size` properties in the stylesheet definitions.
